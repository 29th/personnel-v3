For those units interested in organizing, inviting, and/or attending events
alongside the 29th such as official scrimmages, all queries may be directed to
Community Contact representatives. They can be found below. We prefer that you
start with making a post in the boards linked corresponding to your game but if
you need to last resort contact them make sure to contact the people that also
correspond to your game.
