### Before Enlisting

##### Do I have to use my real name?
Most of us do, but you don't have to; however, we would like for you to pick
a realistic last name, as long as it's not already used. e.g. NOT Pvt. Suicidal
J3di, instead Frank James is more what we are looking for.

##### Do I need to have past gaming/realism experience in order to join the 29th?
No, we welcome players from all skill levels to join the ranks of the 29th.
It's more about the attitude and dedication you show. The 29th will take care
of training you.

##### Does everyone need to go through Basic Combat Training?
Yes, every single member of the unit has gone through BCT - all the way up
to the commander of the 29th - and every new member needs to complete it as
well.

##### What will I learn in BCT?
The basics about realism gaming, the 29th, and the game you choose: 
Arma 3, Rising Storm 2: Vietnam, or Squad.

##### Do I have to use my in-game name and tag all the time when playing?
In the 29th servers you must wear your name and tag at all times. Outside of
the 29th servers it is not required, but it is recommended, as the 29th tag
carries weight and respect.

##### How long will it take to get my application processed?
If you fill out all the information asked, as detailed as possible, it will
be accepted or denied within roughly 48 hours. Complications that require
Headquarters approval may cause your application to take longer to process.

##### Can I practice in the BCT Server when it's empty?
No, you're only allowed on the Platoon Server during the times of BCT.

##### Does the 29th use Teamspeak?
Yes, and it is open to the public. You may find the information
[here](https://forums.29th.org/discussion/15744/29th-id-social-media-and-server-information#latest).

##### How do I get my full name as my in-game name? I can't get my name to fit!
Some names, due to character limits in the games we play, simply do not fit.
This is often an issue in Rising Storm 2: Vietnam with longer names. You may 
find it necessary to shorten your in-game name if this is the case. 
Our Lighthouse staff will assist you if this is the case.

### During BCT

Remember to read the [Cadet Handbook](https://www.29th.org/wiki/FM_21-20_%22Cadet's_Handbook%22)
during BCT!

##### Why can't I connect to the Platoon Server? I've been sitting in a black screen for over 15 mins now and can't attend my first day of BCT!
This is due to a name bug in the game. Disconnect from the black screen by
pressing Esc or F10, change your in-game name to something short like "Pvt."
and reconnect. Still, if you can't connect, contact someone online/in-game from
your BCT's steamgroup.

##### What is a steamgroup?
A steamgroup is a community in Steam. Anyone can create one of their own to
stay in touch with friends, clanmates, people with the same interests etc. It
has features like calendar, announcements, chat room etc.

##### Where can I find my BCT's steamgroup and what is the purpose of it?
The direct link can be found from your enlistment post after a liaison's
reply. You'll get notifications about when your BCT starts, you can easily
contact your BCT buddies, liaisons, ask for help, anything!

##### Where can I find the server password and ip?
All that information can be found at your enlistment post after a liaison
has replied there.

##### If I am the only player from the 29th on our company server, what do I do when someone breaks the rules?
Until you graduate, it is not your duty to enforce 29th rules on our
servers. You can report troublemakers to your Enlistment Liaison by PM (Private
Message) on the forums (nickname, server, time, description of problem).

##### Can I just use any class available in my Company's game, while being in the 29th?
As the rifle is the most common and most effective weapon in the game, all
of our incoming soldiers learn its ins-and-outs. After graduating BCT, soldiers
are given the opportunity to choose an AIT (Advanced Infantry Training) class
such as the Machine Gun, the BAR, the Rifle, the Bazooka, etc. That said, you
are restricted to the rifles (and the grenades, etc. that come with the rifle
classes) at all times during BCT and until you are told otherwise by your squad
leader. Note: this only counts for the 29th servers. On any other server you
are allowed to pick any class you want - but as many have noticed, the rifle
isn't that bad a choice of weapon after all.

##### Where can I find my BCT's steamgroup and what is the purpose of it?
The direct link can be found from your enlistment post after a liaison's
reply. You'll get notifications about when your BCT starts, you can easily
contact your BCT buddies, liaisons, ask for help, anything!
