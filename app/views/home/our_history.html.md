<%= content_for :page_title, 'History of our unit' %>

The 29th Infantry Division was activated on March 14, 2005 playing in both
The Trenches and Battle Grounds. The reputable 29th Infantry Division that
stands before you today participates in the "realism" community of Arma 3, 
Rising Storm 2: Vietnam, and Squad, with past involvement in Day of Defeat, 
the Red Orchestra Modification, Darkest Hour: Normandy 1944, and 
Red Orchestra 2/Rising Storm, and Arma 2.

Prior to August of 2008, the 29th Infantry Division was a unit within the
Half-Life Modification, Day of Defeat. When the 29th started out in Day of
Defeat, there were roughly 17 members, and almost half of them were inactive.
Today, the 29th ID has come to be the largest Realism Unit with almost 500
members. In April 2021, our unit expanded to a true Regimental size and 
shows no sign of showing down.Through training and discipline we've gotten 
to where we stand today. With new members, returning members, and even veteran 
members with more than a decade of service, we continue growing stronger by the day.

Basic Combat Training, or BCT, is one of the ways we accomplish training new
unit members, Cadets, into respectable soldiers of the 29th Infantry Division.
Our intricate and well organized office, Lighthouse, takes care of BCT and
trains every soldier that enters the unit.

Because of Lighthouse and its efforts, our number are constantly growing. There
are many other offices and ways to get involved in the unit; here in the 29th
we don't simply "get by." Hundreds of individuals have put forth hundreds of
hours building the foundation on which this unit stands today, and we are proud
to call ourselves soldiers of the Fightin' 29th!
